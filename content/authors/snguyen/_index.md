Su Nguyen is a Senior Lecturer in Business Analytics & AI and Algorithm Lead at the Centre for Data Analytics and Cognition (CDAC), La Trobe University, Australia. He received his Ph.D. degree in Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research from Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), Wellington, New Zealand, in 2013. His expertise includes simulation-optimization, evolutionary computation, automated algorithm design, interfaces of artificial intelligence and operations research, and their applications in logistics, energy, and transportation. Nguyen has a strong track record in developing simulation models, simulation-based decision support tools, and simulation-optimisation algorithms for industry applications. He has 70+ publications in top peer-reviewed journals and conferences in computational intelligence and operations research. His current research focuses on hybrid intelligence systems that combine the power of modern artificial intelligence technologies and operations research methodologies. He was the chair (2014-2018) of IEEE task force on Evolutionary Scheduling and Combinatorial Optimisation and is a member of IEEE CIS Data Mining and Big Data technical committee. He delivered tutorials about evolutionary simulation-optimisation and AI-based visualisation at Parallel Problem Solving from Nature Conference (2018) and IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (2020).
