## Abstract

Dynamic job shop scheduling has a wide range of applications in reality such as order picking in warehouse. Using genetic programming to design scheduling heuristics for dynamic job shop scheduling problems becomes increasingly common. In recent years, multitask genetic programming-based hyper-heuristic methods have been developed to solve similar dynamic scheduling problem scenarios simultaneously. However, all of the existing studies focus on the tree-based genetic programming. In this paper, we investigate the use of linear genetic programming, which has some advantages over tree-based genetic programming in designing multitask methods, such as building block reusing. Specifically, this paper makes a preliminary investigation on several issues of multitask linear genetic programming. The experiments show that the linear genetic programming within multitask frameworks have a significantly better performance than solving tasks separately, by sharing useful building blocks.
