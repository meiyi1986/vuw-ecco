"This dissertation proposes multiple innovative ideas for developing new hyper-heuristics based on genetic programming that tackle challenging dynamic-flexible production scheduling problems. It develops novel surrogate models, genetic operators, feature selection algorithms and multi-task techniques, significantly improving training efficiency, and the accuracy and interpretability of evolved scheduling rules."
